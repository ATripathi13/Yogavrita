## Understanding Streaks

### Current Streak
- Number of consecutive days you've practiced
- Resets to 0 if you miss a practice day
- Only counts Monday-Saturday (Sunday is rest day)

### Longest Streak
- Your personal best streak
- Never decreases
- Motivates you to beat your record

### How Streaks Work:
- Complete a class to increment your streak
- Practice must be on consecutive days (excluding Sunday)
- Saturday → Monday counts as consecutive
- Missing any practice day (Mon-Sat) resets current streak
- You can only complete one session per day for streak purposes

### Example:
```
Monday: Practice ✓ (Streak: 1)
Tuesday: Practice ✓ (Streak: 2)
Wednesday: Missed ✗ (Streak: 0)
Thursday: Practice ✓ (Streak: 1)
Friday: Practice ✓ (Streak: 2)
Saturday: Practice ✓ (Streak: 3)
Sunday: Rest day (Streak: 3)
Monday: Practice ✓ (Streak: 4)
```
